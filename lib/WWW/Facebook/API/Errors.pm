=over

=item new

Returns a new instance of this class.

=item base

The L<WWW::Facebook::API::Base> object to use to access settings.

=item debug

A boolean set to either true or false, determining if debugging messages
should be carped to STDERR for REST calls.

=item throw_errors

A boolean set to either true of false, signifying whether or not log_error
should carp when an error is returned from the REST server.

A boolean. True if the last call was a success, false otherwise.

=item last_error

A string holding the error message of the last failed call to the REST server.

=item log_string

Pass in the params and the response from a call, and it will make a formatted
string out of it showing the server_uri, the parameters used, and the response
received. Used by log_debug and log_error.

=back


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Any error that is thrown is most likely an API error as well.

=over

=item C< 104: Incorrect signature >

This one in particular might get you: make sure you have passed in (desktop =>

because the wrong session key will be passed in.
